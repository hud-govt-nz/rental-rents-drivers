"The private dwelling estimates have as a base the census count of occupied private dwellings plus unoccupied dwellings from the 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2013, and 2018 Censuses."
"Estimates of private dwellings by tenure are derived by applying tenure proportions to the private dwelling estimates."
"The tenure proportions are based on census information on tenure of households in private occupied dwellings (excluding visitor-only dwellings)."
"The intercensal tenure proportions are calculated by linearly interpolating between the census tenure proportions."
"From the March 2018 quarter, the tenure proportions applied to the dwelling estimate are held constant at the 2018 Census tenure proportions."
"The tenure 'owner-occupied' includes dwellings owned by individuals or held in a family trust (from 2006)."
"The tenure 'provided free' includes dwellings provided free to households by individuals, private trusts, businesses, and government agencies."
"The dwelling and household estimates for the December 2021, March 2022, and June 2022 quarters have been revised, following to the revision of the building consent - BLD series in July 2022."
